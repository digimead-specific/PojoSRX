=====================

Quoting from the original page:

This repository is mostly a mirror of the PojoSR project available on Google Code:

My modifications are marginal and mostly consist of code-cleanups.

The reason why I have setup this repository on GitHub is because I find more convenient working with Git.
If something valuable will come from my experiments, I will obviously try to contribute it upstream.
